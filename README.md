# **MANERO** ‚ìÇÔ∏è

A made up e-commerce site made with [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) and [React](https://react.dev/)

## Description

This project is part of the course submission at the .NET developer program at [ECUtbildning](https://ecutbildning.se/).

It was a group project aiming to practice agile working methodologies and project management. We worked together in a team of eight and used Jira as our project management system.

### Backend üßõ

Our API was built using ASP.NET Core. We used Entity Framework Core as our database ORM with SQLite. Tests for the API were written using xUnit.

### Frontend üåû

The frontend was built using React and SCSS. Since we used Vite as our dev server we also chose to use vitest for testing the frontend.

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Create and populate a local SQLite database file by running:

```sh
$ cd backend
$ dotnet ef database update
